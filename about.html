        <h3>A Bit More Personal.</h3>
        <p> Growing up in St. Thomas and Puerto Rico provided me with a diverse set of skills and experiences that aided me with the tools to embrace people and perspectives that were different from my own.
            
            My time in the military afforded me the opportunity to lead Soldiers with empathy and creativity to become the best version of themselves professionally and personally. My track record of competence, leadership, and ability to perform in high-pressure situations has also led me to earn various positions of increased responsibility for multi-functional teams, strategic planning, and consulting.
            
            I look forward to making an impact while utilizing this platform to grow and enrich my connections.</p>
