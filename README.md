# KhiryMPersonalWebsite
Personal website to display familiarity with git, html, css and javascript as part of block 9 of FSA.
For this project I will create a landing page, an about page and a portfolio page.
The goal will be to become more comfortable with writting semantic HTML, basic CSS and Javascript while using a GitHub repository.
